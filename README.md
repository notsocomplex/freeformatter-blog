FreeFormatter - Blog
==================

This respository contains all of the code that is used on [blog.freeformatter.com](http://blog.freeformatter.com "FreeFormatter - Blog"). I make no garranty on the code and you can use it freely to whatever means. It is done to the best of my knowledge but could have bugs or faults. If you run into an issue, please report it. 

Constructive comments are always appreciated. Contact me on freeformatter@gmail.com.

Make sure to visit [www.freeformatter.com](http://www.freeformatter.com "Free Online Tools For Developers") also to try a huge set of free tools for developers such as code formatters, validators, encoders etc.


Instructions
============
Each sub-project of this repository should contain the gradle wrapper (execute using gradlew) and the generated pom.xml in case you want to use maven instead. I also left the .project file of eclipse in case you ever want to import the project there. If possible, install the gradle eclipse plugin or the maven plugin using marketplace and then import the projects.
